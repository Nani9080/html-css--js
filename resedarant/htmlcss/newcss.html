    <h1> logic first</h1>
    <p>Next step involves the tradition of 16-step puja wherein shodasha means 16 and upachara means devoutly offering the lord, in Sanskrit.

        Having washed Ganeshas feet, the idol is bathed in milk, ghee, honey, curd, sugar (panchamrit snan) followed by scented oil and then ganga jal. Then new vastra/clothes are offered (vastra, uttariya samarpan); along with flowers, unbroken rice (Akshata), garland, sindoor, and chandan. The idol is decked and worshipped religiously by offering modak, betel leaves, coconut (naivedya) lighting incense sticks, diyas, chanting hymns, mantras.</p>
